    "In practice, how often do we \"know\" the variogram for each property we want to estimate?  Or is a variogram even appropriate to describe the spatial patterns and characteristics of the property?!  These are difficult questions to grapple with in applied groundwater modeling.  However, if we choose to stay with the variogram concept, but acknowledge that concept may itself be subject to some assumptions and, therefore, uncertainty, this leads to the idea that the variogram quantites (i.e. correlation length, anisotropy, and bearing) themselves are also \"uncertain\" and might should be accounted for the inverse/inference problem (by parameterizing them)...and that the uncertainty in those variogram quantities might also be spatially varying.  WAT?!  This is getting deep...these types of situations lead to a hierarchical structure in the inverse/inference problem and these parameters that inform the variogram quantities are typically called \"hyperparameters\".  Whew!\n",
