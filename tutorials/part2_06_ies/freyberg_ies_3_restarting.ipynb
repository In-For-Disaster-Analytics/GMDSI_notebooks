    "# Restarting PESTPP-IES\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very common to want to restart PESTPP-IES using existing results.  The most common reason is to evaluate the prior parameter ensemble - that is, to run the prior through the model and check the simulated results for coherence and common sense.  Once you are happy with (or not completely unhappy with) the prior results, you might then want to try a small number of iterations with PESTPP-IES.  If your model runs fast, then you can just fire off PESTPP-IES again just as before but with `noptmax` greater than 0.  But if your model takes a while, it can be costly to re-run the prior parameter ensemble again.  In this case, you can easily restart PESTPP-IES with the existing ensemble files.  In this notebook, we will demonstrate this workflow.  We note that while we will focus on restarting with the prior ensemble results, PESTPP-IES can be restarted from any previous PESTPP-IES result files\n"

    "\n",
    "Ok, now that some actual science and critical thinking has been done, its time to try some parameter adjustments. To do that, let's save some computational budget and restart PESTPP-IES.\n",

    " - parameter ensemble (iteration specific), option name: `ies_parameter_ensemble`\n",
    " - obs+noise ensemble, option name `ies_observation_ensemble`\n",
    " - simulated output ensemble (iteration specific), option name: `ies_restart_observation_ensemble`\n",
    " \n",
    "The parameter ensemble and simulated output ensembles must be from the same iteration but PESTPP-IES has no way of knowing this, so it's up to you not to mess this up!  In the current example, we want to restart with the prior ensemble results, so the files we seek are \"<case_name>.0.par.csv\" and \"<case>.0.obs.csv\" for the parameter and simulated ensemble files respectively (note that if you are using binary formats, the files would end with \".jcb\" instead of \".csv\").  If you wanted to restart PESTPP-IES using iteration 3 results, you would pass \"<case>.3.par.csv\" and \"<case>.3.obs.csv\".  An important point here is that PESTPP-IES has no way of knowing that the restart files originated from iteration 3, so in the new PESTPP-IES run, the files names will start at zero again. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The obs+noise ensemble is written during the initialization PESTPP-IES and does not change over a PESTPP-IES run. Its name is always \"<case_name>.obs+noise.csv\" (or \".jcb\"). Important note: even if you are not using noise on your observations (e.g. the PEST++ option \"ies_no_noise\" is False), this file is made by PESTPP-IES and is needed on restart.\n",
    "    \n",
    "So! To restart PESTPP-IES, we just need to add/modify these 3 options aaaaannnndddd WHAMMY! you jump straight to upgrade calculations...\n",
    "    \n",
